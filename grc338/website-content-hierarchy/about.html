            <h1>About Us</h1>
    <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="The front of the San Luis Obispo bakery location">
            
            <p>We are a locally owned bakery in the heart of downtown San Luis Obispo, California. It all started with a mom and daughter duo who have always had a passion for baking. After years of selling our baked goods locally from the porch of our San Luis Obispo home, we decided in 2015 to open up a shop to expand our business.</p>
            
            <p>Since 2015, we have seen our business really take off. We put all of our love into our products which make them so special to the SLO community. We have since expanded our business even more by opening new shops in Pismo Beach, California in 2017 and Paso Robles, California in 2020. </p>
            
            <p>We love the community we serve and are constantly looking for ways to give back. Since the opening of our first shop we have donated over $10,000 to local non profits that help edcate and house the youth of the central coast. We do this by donating 10% of all sales to local orgaizations.</p>
            
            <p>If you are looking for fresh, organic and locally made baked goods look no father than Buzz Bakery. We are hope to see you soon!</p>
