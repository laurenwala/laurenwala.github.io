        </figure>
        <p>We are a locally owned crystal shop in the heart of downtown San Luis Obispo, California. It all started with a spiritual journey. When the owner of Crystal SLO experienced the natural healing of crystal, she knew she had to share it with the world, starting in her own backyard.</p>
        <p>In 2015, owner Eve Jennings opened her shop in downtown San Luis Obispo, selling crystals and stones she source sustainably and ehtically from around the world. Since then the shop has grown its inventory to include stones, jewlrey and books that offer information on how to use cyrstals and stones for natural healing. </p>
        <p>We love the community we serve and are constantly looking for ways to give back. Since the opening of our shop we have donated over $10,000 to local non profits that help with medical costs of SLO county residents. We do this by donating 10% of all sales to local orgaizations.</p>
        <p>If you are looking start your natual healing journey, look no farther than Crystal SLO. We hope to see you soon!</p>
